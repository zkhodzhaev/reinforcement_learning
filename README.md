# reinforcement_learning
 Why?: Keras implementation of a blog post (Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels) that originally used Python's numpy library for neural network operations.

During testing, the trained model was executed using pure Python in Jupyter Notebook:

### Next, this model was implemented using Keras and TensorFlow. Here, I show the model and its one-run reward 
#### (Note: these models are run < day. More training will improve performance):
